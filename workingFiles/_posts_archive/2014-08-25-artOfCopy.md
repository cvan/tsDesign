# The Ancient Art of Copying

## Knowing why something is good is the key to good theft

It's a well known fact that all designers are creative geniuses who pull pure success out of their magical brains and sell it to the world. It's also a well known fact that most well known facts are lies. I stole that joke. More accurately, I synthesized it. I made some tweaks to it to make it fit my into my blog piece better, but by in large I didn't make that up. I just remembered it, decided it would be a good opener and ran with it. In case you were curious, this is a large part of what I do for a living, it's called design. 

## There are no original ideas, so the Internet tells me

I'm not going to go on a diatribe about how there are no original ideas anymore. Or how there are seven major themes that make up every story ever told by humans. I don't know if that's true or not and I don't really care. In the design business the majority of what we do is mashups, there are no bonuses for pure originality. Your client/stakeholder wants something like they've seen their competitor has. Your customers want something like that old version they had. You want something like you saw in that awards show or in that fancy design blog. Along the way there is an actual problem to be solved at the center of all of these desires. Using these various sources of prior art for inspiration, or a jumping off point, or flat out just copying because they solved the same problem you have really well is part of the game. You take the bits and pieces of the things you've seen, the things you've learned from your client and the things you've learned from the people who will actually be using whatever it is you're making, mash them all together and boom, you're now doing design. See, no originality except in your particular choice of things you mashed together, or synthesized. That's the job, the problem comes when you start grabbing things randomly. 

## Let's make some cookies!

Why do you but vanilla in chocolate chip cookies? Are they key to the chocolate-chippyness that you may be looking to bring into another new, better cookie? Or is it the chocolate chips themselves? What about the type of sugar? If you were going for a chocolate chip style cookie, but with more snicker doodle texture, you'd want to know how the pieces of each of those recipes works before you start mixing and mashing, right? Otherwise you end up with Frankencookies. 

Yet, when we're designing products it's not that uncommon to do something because "Hot app of the week" does it like that or "the competition does it like this" without ever stopping to ask "Why do they do it that way?" Once again, we end up with Frankencookies, which turns out are not a viable product, they just get chased around with torches and pitchforks.

## "Is this thing worth stealing?" 

Ninety-nine percent of all international jewel thieves ask themselves "Is this worth stealing?" before they pull a heist. It's a well known fact. As designers we need to adopt this as our motto. The popularity of something is not, generally, enough of a reason to copy it into whatever you happen to be making. Popularity is fickle; and it turns out developing products, both the kind made of bits and the kind made of atoms, takes time. The odds of the thing that's cool right now that you're copying still being cool by the time your product launches are slim. Your Frankencookies are not only being chased by the villagers, they're still behind the competition. 

More than just missing out on a fad, you need to understand what problem the thing you're about to steal is actually solving and then you need to ask yourself if that's a problem you actually have. Copying a really sweet solution for sorting a billion items isn't really very worthwhile if you only ever have to sort five, right? How about copying the handle of that coffee mug you really love to put on a case that will eventually hold 500 pounds? These are extreme but we do nearly similar things all the time and pat ourselves on the back for it. In fact, what you're copying might be a terrible solution for your specific problem. Introducing new problems is not what you get paid for as a designer, solving the problems that were brought to you is. If it isn't actually solving a problem you have, it's not worth stealing. 

## Synthesis good, Frankencookies bad!!

Just like there are no bonuses for pure originality, there are also no bonuses for reinventing the wheel. Design requires synthesis, aka creating mashups. Good synthesis requires understanding all the pieces you have on hand and evaluating them to see if they actually will help you solve the problem in front of you. Before you decide to do something because "Hot product on the block does it like this" ask yourself, "Is this worth stealing?"
