# Say what you mean...

I'm going to say something that might really shock a lot of people, or at least a lot of IT pros on the internet. Words have meanings. You can't just take your 1972 Ford Pinto and call it a Rolls-Royce Phantom and have people actually believe that you own a Rolls-Royce. Because it's not a Rolls, it's a Ford. And it's not a Phantom, it's a Pinto. In the last 2 weeks I have seen an increasingly large number of uses of the term "UX" when the writer/speaker clearly means something else entirely. [Ed: In fact, I just ran across another one on Twitter while I was writing this.] So why doesn't this idea of "words mean things" apply to the term "User Experience" and it's associated acronym "UX?"


## Real world examples of this misuse of the term UX

* "At the core of our culture is a passion for innovative, minimalist UX..." -- A job description I received last week
* "The best product documentation is a good UX" -- A job description I used in a recent research project
* "We're looking for a skilled UX developer to design and code the UX for our web and mobile applications" -- A job description I found by searching for "UX Developer" just now

## It's easier to name things you can see

Look around whatever room you're in right now. What object is sitting next to you? How about across the room to your left? You can probably pretty easily name everything in your room 'cos you can see it, but what's the name of an idea that's difficult to understand? Is it murky? Fuzzy? Complex? Complicated? The word I was thinking of when I asked was, Obtuse, but all those others are pretty close, right? This is the problem with "User Experience," you can't see it so you can't easily identify it. "Ahh, this is the problem we have with 'UX' then, we don't know what it is!" you may be saying. I say nay-nay. Sure, this is part of the problem. When you ask someone to describe a "user experience" you usually have a better chance of picking winning lottery numbers than guessing what the answer will be, but most "UX Professionals" have a pretty solid definition of what a user experience is, it's an experience someone has with a product or service.

## "UX" is not an interchangeable term for UI, GUI, or Graphic Design

"UI" - meaning "User Interface" 
"GUI" - meaning "Graphical User Interface" 
Graphic Design - meaning "The design of graphics" (yes this isn't a very complete definition, but you get the idea)

An interface is not an experience. A picture is not an experience. A very well designed, minimalist, clean Dieter Rams inspired interface is not an experience. You can't build an experience in HTML5 or Javascript or C# or Objective-C. You can't build one on an assembly line, or out of assembly code. They're not made out of aluminum and glass or carbon fiber. An experience is a personal reaction to something, informed by it's owner's previous life experiences, history and emotions. An experience is metaphysical. You can't design or develop one.

Webster's defines an interface as "the place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other." While you can absolutely have experiences with and centering around a user interface, a UI is NOT an experience. And we have perfectly good words and acronyms to describe user interfaces already like: UI and GUI (now the most common type of human-computer user interfaces). You can design and build interfaces. You can have minimalist interfaces, and blue interfaces. You can believe that the best interfaces don't need any documentation (although you'd be seriously limiting the complexity of what your interface could do, but that's a completely different conversation.) We can build "pixel-perfect mockups" of interfaces and build "responsive" interfaces out of HTML, CSS and Javascript. We can design interfaces for mobile and for the web, for products made out of atoms and products made out of bits. Interfaces are what WE make. What we design, build and test. Experiences are what results when a user and an interface meet. Experiences can be good or bad, brief or prolonged, but but they're highly subjective most of the time, and almost wholly out of our control.

## Why is this important?

UX has become an umbrella term. It's an umbrella term for good reason, it takes a lot of different things and some luck to create a good user experience. Your product has to be well designed, well built, well marketed, and your user has to be in a good mindset to turn all that hard work you and your team did into a "good experience." Imagine if you will:

You buy a new iPhone5. You love the industrial design, had an iPod touch and have bought into a lot of the apps in the eco system already, agree with the aesthetics and interaction choices of iOS and you love every visit you've ever made to the Apple store in your town. All these are touch points designed by Apple for you, and they push you most of the way to your great iPhone experience. At least as much as they can. What if you had to wait in a 3 hour line to buy that iPhone5, 2 months after launch day, and your boss had just threatened to fire you before you left work to head over to the Apple store, then after you finally get your phone and get outside you're FaceTiming away with your friend and someone bumps into you. You drop your new phone on the grass next to the sidewalk and the front glass shatters and you're left with a nearly useless and ugly device. Apple couldn't control any of that, and all of those things that made up this very bad first iPhone5 experience will very likely color your future experiences with the device.

UX is an umbrella term because it takes a lot of people working on a lot of different things to achieve. A product with a good experience is floating in a sea of well designed touch points (aka interactions) between the user and the company. To relegate the idea of a user's experience with a product to that product's interface is to completely miss the point about user experience as product differentiator. To assume good "UX" can be achieved simply with icons, minimalist layouts, responsive visual grids and HTML and Javascript code is no different than to assume you could get to the moon if you brought a helicopter to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Both assumptions will leave you far short of your goal.

Words mean things. A user interface(UI) is not a user experience(UX) any more than a Ford Pinto is a Rolls Royce Phantom. If we, the people who are supposed to be experts in this stuff, can't even say what we mean how are we supposed to expect anyone else to? How can we expect anyone to make better products if we're not even engaged enough to make sure companies understand the difference between an experience and an interface? UX is a really hot buzzword right now, I know, but we need to make an effort to stop people from throwing the term around carelessly, because after enough people ask for one thing and get something completely different enough times, they're going to decide UX isn't that important after all, even if they've never given real UX a try.
