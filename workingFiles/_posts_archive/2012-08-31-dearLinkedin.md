# Dear LinkedIn, we have a problem...

It should come as no surprise to anyone that I am fairly concerned about the accuracy and updated-ness (is that a word? :p ) of my LinkedIn profile \( Shameless Plug: [http://www.linkedin.com/in.notjustprettypictures](http://www.linkedin.com/in.notjustprettypictures) \) I get a lot of traffic from recruiters on the site, because I work in the tech industry and it seems to be the place to go to for tech recruiters. I like the site, I've been using it for years. I even like the look of their new UI (for full profiles, the short profiles still look exactly the same as they always have.) But, dear LinkedIn, we have a problem. A usability problem. An information design problem, that sadly I am powerless to fix in your new template. People can't find my portfolio link. I put it in the "websites" section of my profile, like you asked, and even listed it as "portfolio" in the drop down of descriptions for the URL. This is what you've given me in return...

Why have you hidden it? It's the thing people want to see the most (except for my resume, which is also on my profile in theÂ  "Experience" section, but I assume everyone is just attached to the old PDF resume I have, and that's ok.) This is a serious problem, if I'm to use this service as one of my primary job hunting tools. It's supposed to be my "professional profile on the web." And that's how I've used it for years, but now, my dear, sweet LinkedIn, you've broken it. I can't even use the headline as a workaround without having to cut my message short, because you've limited the number of characters.

I understand wanting to contain communication to your platform, you are ad supported like all social networks. But, you're not Facebook. You're not Twitter. You're not a place for unfocused communications about whatever. You're LinkedIn, the social network for "grown-ups", the social network for professionals. Professionals need to be able to share their past successes, professional designers need to have their portfolios seen, and more and more professional developers need to have theirs seen too. (GitHub links, anyone?) So, please unhide my portfolio link. There's a nice little space under "Education" in your very lovely contact card for it. Want to keep the rest of my links hidden in the contact drop-down area? Fine. I get it. Too many options, not a good thing. I agree. But give me one link that doesn't require any digging to find. One link in the open, at the top of the page. Until then...
