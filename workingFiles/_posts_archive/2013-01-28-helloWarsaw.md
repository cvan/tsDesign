# Hello Warsaw!!!

![Photo of me speaking at Firefox OS App Days Warsaw](/blog/img/warsawTalk.jpg )

I was fortunate enough to get to jet across the pond, and all of the United States and a large part of Europe, to give a talk in Warsaw, Poland about mobile app design as part of the Firefox OS App Days events that happened yesterday around the globe (and last week in CA). It was a BLAST, I met some great developers who showed off some really cool apps after the hack-a-thon, and I got to meet our great Mozilla team in Poland (and other parts of central Europe). I took a bunch of pictures and you can check them all out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tsmuse/sets/72157632633209079/" target="_blank">on my Flickr page.</a>
