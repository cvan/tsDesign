# Your &quot;user experience&quot; may be leaking...

Last week I was doing a "design exercise" for a potential employer and in my solution I mentioned "the email your system automatically sent me." You see, I had signed up for a trial of their software before I jumped into redesigning the thing they asked me to redesign, and the auto generated email was actually the perfect place to fix the problem they had identified. They were "concerned" that I had focused so much attention on the email, and not on the user interface. "The User Experience is more than just the graphical user interface of your software," was my used more than I care to think about in my reply.

In the end, they were not impressed, so I'm still available if you are and would like to hire me. Even if that isn't the case, take this freebie with you: if you have "UX Designers" or "UX People" and you're only allowing them to focus on the GUI, you're not really designing a full experience. It's leaking into your other touch points right under your nose.
