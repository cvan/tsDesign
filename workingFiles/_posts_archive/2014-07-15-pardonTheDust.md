# Pardon the dust

Hi there, 

This is the new, post-wordpress-pocolypse blog. It tunrs out that it takes longer than you'd think to convert the XML file that Wordpress spits out as a back-up into a bunch of markdown files, so the blog isn't really complete right now. I'm slowly adding things back, starting from most recent posts before the old site went haywire, so if you're looking for something that I wrote in 2008, it might be a couple days before it's live and up here. Also I lost most of the images that were stored in the weird Wordpress "media library" that apparently didn't get kicked out when I did a backup, so a mlot of the old "working on now" posts are gone forever. (Note: you should make sure you just copy the whole damn site from your server, ALL THE FILES. It's the only way to be sure.)

I'm also working on some new stuff, which will hopefully get posted before I finish brining back all the old stuff. I have a folder of unpublshed blog posts that need a little polish and they'll be ready to start their new lives on the internet... or at least the internet that isn't dropbox. Anyhow, thanks for stopping by. In the very 1990s spirit of this "this site is under construction" message, and because I will miss having them on my homepage, here are the dancing MC Hammers. Enjoy :)
