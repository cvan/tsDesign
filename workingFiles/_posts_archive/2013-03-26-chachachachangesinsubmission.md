# Cha-cha-cha-changes, in the way you submit your apps, cha-cha-changes.
 
I can't stress enough how absolutely great it is to be able to share what I'm working on at work as I'm working on it. This is a first, though. This is the first time I've been able to share not just a picture, but a fully working prototype. Fun huh? So what is this? Well, we're working on improving the experience of submitting apps to the Firefox Marketplace, and this is what we're more or less envisioning. You can play with the prototype (built in Axure) at <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/~asantos/devhubSubmission032013/" target="_blank">my people.mozilla.org space</a>. Cool, huh? If you want to know more about the research I did that lead us to this design, stay tuned to the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/ux/">Mozilla UX blog</a>, my write up about that should be coming soon.
