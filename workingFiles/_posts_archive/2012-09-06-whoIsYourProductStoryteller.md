# Who is your product&#039;s storyteller?

I just had this very awesome article sent to me, ["Why We Need Storytellers at the Heart of Product Development"](http://uxmag.com/articles/why-we-need-storytellers-at-the-heart-of-product-development) and I'm glad someone with a louder voice than mine is saying this stuff. Storytelling is key to a good experience, because often times the only way to describe an experience is with a story. Wireframes? storytelling details. Mockups? Storytelling aid. Functional specs? Story details. All of these artifacts, and all the other artifacts we UX designers create are part of a story that is our solution to the problem at hand. 

Stories are one of the most powerful tools a UX designer (or any designer for that matter) has.  There's a reason so much of our culture and history is kept in the form of stories. They are powerful. They're primal. They're human. Storytelling makes abstract ideas easier to understand, and gives emotional connection to things. They make mundane lists of details and tasks more enjoyable. They make a collection of tasks an experience. Why wouldn't you want your product to have a story?

Too often, as the article points out, there is no ownership for this product story, because we are often too focused about implementation details. Is it Agile? Is it Lean? These two implementation methodologies are often used as a shield against any kind of larger scale planing, as if someone having a big picture view would render them useless. (As a designer, some of my biggest challenges are this idea that everything about a company must be Agile or Lean, or the train will come off the tracks.) But it's not true. You can have a story, that unifies your product and still build it in an Agile and/or Lean way. In fact, you're likely to find that having a good product story to go back to means your sprints and releases are much more productive because everyone understands what the end goal is. You wouldn't take a trip across the country without a map, why would you spend thousands or millions of dollars designing and building a product without one?

UX Designers are uniquely qualified to be the keepers of product stories, because it fits in so closely with the rest of what we do. We have to tell the stories about the users to the company, and in testing sessions tell the story of the product to the users. Now, this doesn't mean that the creation of the story is solely the domain of the UX Designer. Everyone should be involved in shaping the product story, business stake holders, technology stakeholders, developers, designers, marketers, founders, CEOs, etc, etc. But the UX designer is uniquely qualified to be the keep of the story, to ensure the narrative is complete, and not fractured. You're already trusting us to build and maintain user profile/personas, why not let us keep one on the product for you too?

If you want a good test for the next time you have to interview a potential new UX designer, have them write you a story. Anyone can quickly learn to draw wireframes or mockups, the things most interviewers want to see. The skill of my craft comes not in the act of producing artifacts, but in the thinking behind them. This is what you're really paying for, and a great way to see that thinking in action is to ask them to tell you a story.
