 * Are you looking for the market/styles to figure out how something works? 
 * That's how I learned and ultimately ened up with a pretty rad career, sadly it's not 
 * as easy as "view source" anymore. This site was built using Jekyll, SASS, Breakpoint, and Susy.
 * You should check out the project on github to see the real code.
