<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p>Ultimate Money Skills is a joint venture between Monster’s Making it Count and Bank of America. This redesign was an attempt to drive more repeat traffic to the site and after an initial evaluation it was clear that there was little incentive to motivate repeat use. Our redesign addressed the causes of the lack of user incentive while working inside the guidelines and constraints put in place by both companies.</p>

<h2>The reasons for low return rates</h2>
<p>The site was essentially a collection of articles, organized by topics. Our research showed that most of our target users were looking for specific, task based information not broad topics. The topic headings didn’t help them find what they were looking for because they were not always sure where to look. The articles were also not updated frequently enough to generate many repeat visits. The contest area of the site, which was updated monthly,saw the most repeat traffic although this was still only tens of users (mean of 45 users per month over a 12 month period.) From the server logs and the interviews we conducted with our student advisory board, we determined there needed to be a larger component to the site that engaged users in a way that would make them want to come back more than just entering a monthly contest.</p>

<h2>Key changes</h2>
<p>In addition to the visual redesign we did to bring the site more in line with Bank of America’s Morris on Campus campaign, our design proposed a few key changes to the structure of the site to drive a higher level of repeat engagement.</p>

<h3>The Knowledge Bank</h3>
{% include njppthumb-left.html imgSrc="img/ums2.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 02" caption="The Knowledge Bank wrireframe to live site" %}
<p>The main goal both Monster and Bank of America had for the site was to make it a resource for financial education and literacy for young adults. While the subject areas covered by the site’s content was sufficient, the navigation methods were not. All the students we talked to described needing to find items in a task-centered way. They were looking for an answer to a question. The existing site’s organization didn’t allow for this kind of specific answers to the questions they had, it required searching through topic areas to find relevant content.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>To solve this problem, we gathered the most frequent questions people were going to the site to answer and turned them into a new navigation system, the Knowledge Bank. The Knowledge Bank was just a guided navigation system, funneling people to the most relevant articles to the most frequently asked questions in plain language, e.g “I really need to figure out something about bank accounts” opened a new set of questions like
{% include njppthumb-right.html imgSrc="img/ums3.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 03" caption="The Knowledge Bank on a content page" %}
“What does my interest rate mean on my savings account?” that linked to a specific article that answered the question. This funnel approach put the users two clicks away from the most frequently sought information on the site, while allowing us to leave the existing navigation and organization structure in place, as requested by the site’s sponsors.</p>

<h3>Interactive tools</h3>
<p>The addition of interactive tools was not completely new, the site already had a few calculators. We added a budgeting tool, a credit card simulator and a trivia game called The Financial Challenge. The Financial Challenge allowed users to replay to improve their score, and the questions would be updated periodically to entice users to return and continue to maintain their current level of mastery of financial knowledge.</p>

<h3>Social aspects</h3>
{% include njppthumb-left.html imgSrc="img/ums4.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 04" caption="The creation of accounts and reccomended content were part of making the site a more social place" %}
<p>The most important addition to the site was the introduction of profiles and social interaction between users of the site. By creating a community around the content at Ultimate Money Skills, we believe the incentive to return will be much greater. This included adding user profiles, comments and voting buttons to every article posted on the site, badges and shared scores on all the games, and a profile page that users could customize and that acted as a central hub to all their activity on the site.</p>

<h2> The Result </h2>
{% include njppthumb-left.html imgSrc="img/ums5.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 05" caption="Redesigned home page and content page on the live site" %}
<p>While many of the recommendations were pushed into a later phase of site development, the addition of the interactive tools and the guided navigation did provide a significant increase in repeat visits to the site in the first months it was launched. With my departure from Monster Worldwide in late 2009 I no longer have access to information about the site or the success of the redesign, but it appeared to be progressing along the proposed plan until it disapeared from the Internet in early 2014.</p>

 <h3>New homepage</h3>                   
<p>The original homepage for Ultimate Money Skills was a very long summary of everything on the site. The new homepage cut most of the clutter and replaced it with easily accessible paths to content. {% include njppthumb-right.html imgSrc="img/ums6.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 06" caption="Wireframe for the new homepage" %}The majority of the real estate on the page featured the new guided navigation, featured articles and links to the interactive tools on the site, which were completely buried in the original design. This consolidation of content eliminated the overwhelming number of options on the original homepage and made the content more accessible, despite requiring more clicks to reach it, by emphasizing search and the new guided navigation option for content that was not a currently featured article. This new design more closely aligned with the user’s “search for specific information” behavior than the old design did.</p>

<h3>Simplified log-in</h3>
{% include njppthumb-left.html imgSrc="img/ums7.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 07" caption="Wireframe showing login interaction" %}
<p>The existing log-in process on Ultimate Money Skills required the user going to the log-in page and then being returned to the homepage after log in to the site. This interaction was problematic if the user had just spent considerable time trying to find some content without logging in or creating an account first, because the site blocked access to full articles unless the user was logged in and it returned the user to the homepage to restart their search for the content after they did. As simple as it may seem in hindsight, designing the new Ultimate Money Skills site to support log-in and account creation in a modal window was a huge improvement to the experience of using the site. Users could not only log-in when they hit the content wall without being punished, it created a more consistent experience for anyone entering the site through an article or section page. They were no longer snapped back to the homepage without a clue of how to get back to where they were before they created an account or logged in.</p>

<h3>Guided navigation &mdash; The Knowledge Bank</h3>
{% include njppthumb-right.html imgSrc="img/ums8.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 08" caption="Wireframe for the homepage Knowledge Bank" %}                    
<p>The Knowledge Bank, the new guided navigation option, allowed paths to the most popular content via links that were written in the language of the target audience (high school and college students) not the language of bankers and marketers. The largest complaint the original Ultimate Money Skills site faced was that the content on the site was difficult to find. It was buried in a series of menus that made sense only if you understood how most banks organize their products. Because Ultimate Money Skills was a site that was supposed to teach this information, it’s audience by and large found the main navigation difficult to use and content difficult to find. For example, In the Knowledge Bank instead of the path to an article about Debit Accounts being “Banking > Checking Accounts > Debit and ATM Cards” it was presented as either “I need to figure something out about my banking account > What’s the deal with my Debit Card” or “Where’s my money going every month?!?! > What’s the Deal with my Debit Card?” These paths are not only more direct, they’re in the language of young adults, many of whom did not intuitively navigate the tree of financial services laid out by the original site’s full-grown adult authors. The Knowledge Bank tested very well with young audiences, as it let them find the answers to their questions by finding a question very similar to the one they were asking as their starting point. </p>

<h3>Order to chaos with section landing pages</h3>
{% include njppthumb-left.html imgSrc="img/ums9.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 09" caption="Wireframe showing section landing page with both possible headers" %}
<p>The original section template was simply an unordered list of all the articles that were in a section of the Ultimate Money Skills website. While that list didn’t disappear from the new template design, there were significant additions to the information architecture of the site and access to additional tools that made navigating the content of the site much easier, and allowed older content to be found as easily as newer content. The top of every section page included access to The Knowledge Bank, in either a clarification state, for users who landed on the page via a knowledge bank link from the homepage, or in a section specific state that simply winnowed down the options presented to topics that were contained in the section. The clarification state of The Knowledge Bank was an important feature in the “Broad to Specific” style of questions used for navigation. Options presented in this state were focused links to specific articles.</p>
                    
<p>Another new addition was a curated content list for each section called “Our Top Choices.”This was originally going to be a user generated top 5 list using a voting system, but technical and business constraints forced us to compromise on a staff rated list. This list represented the most relevant articles in the section and presented another shortcut to the most demanded content on the site. </p>

<h3>Read and then find some other things to read &mdash; a more engaging article page</h3>
{% include njppthumb-right.html imgSrc="img/ums10.png" altTxt="Ultimate Money SKills 10" caption="Wireframe for article page template" %}
<p>The redesigned article page templates are intentionally very similar to section page templates. One of the main goals of the redesign project was to increase time on site for our visitors. While adding interactive content and surfacing the interactive tools on the site were one way to help drive this, my main solution to increase time on site was to increase the “link diving” or “shelf reading” like behavior one sees at well linked sites like Wikipedia. By offering the users related content on each article page, something the old site did not do, we greatly increased the chance they would read 3 or 4 related articles per visit instead of just the one article that answered the specific question they came to the site with. To this end, The Knowledge Bank at the top of the page template offers related articles in the same audience voice it has on both the homepage as well as the section pages, and the Our Top Choices list from the section page remains on the article page, to elevate more popular articles and topics related to that section of the site. Both of these mechanisms put more content in easy reach of the users, something the original site failed to do.</p>
